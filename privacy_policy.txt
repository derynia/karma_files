However, this process does not involve sending any personal or user-generated data over the internet.

All your inputs are securely stored on your device. We do not use cloud storage or any remote servers to store your data.

4. No Third-Party Services
This app does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising services, or tracking tools.

5. Your Control
You have complete control over the information you input into the app.
Deleting the app will permanently remove all locally stored data.
